                    The University of Rizal System deems it essential to sustain its efforts on the internationalization
                    of operations. The twin functions of research and extension are very significant and therefore
                    keeping abreast on the new developments will be of great help to the academic community. The
                    continued dissemination of significant information will therefore ensure that academic, research and
                    training institutions are making scholarly outputs and community development outcomes accessible to
                    stakeholders. The 2024 URS International Multidisciplinary Research and Extension Advocacy
                    Conference for Champions of Change <b>(IMREACH)</b> intends to serve as an avenue for researchers
                    and
                    extension practitioners across disciplines to share relevant information, research outputs and best
                    practices in community development. This will benefit the interested groups with enhanced
                    understanding and appreciation of research development and extension services not only as
                    institutional mandates but as commitment to help improve life. The international multidisciplinary
                    research and extension advocacy conference for champions of change will give opportunity to widen
                    prospects, strengthen partnerships and gain knowledge on innovative and scaled up initiatives for
                    more empowered communities.
